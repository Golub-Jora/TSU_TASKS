#define N 5 - declaration of the constant N
typedef long int MyInt; - type defined as an alias for long int.
double g(int, int); - a function that takes two arguments of type int and returns a value of type double.
int a = 100; - a global variable of type int with a value of 100.
float a; - a local variable of type float that shadows the global variable "a" inside the main function.
int d = 123, t = 456; - variables d and t are of type int.
double n, m; - local variables of type double used to store the results of calculations.
MyInt l = 0; - a variable l of type MyInt (long int) initialized with a value of 0.
At the end of the program, n = 8 and m = 579.
