1) 10 10 10 10 10. 
2) 10 9 8 7 6
In the first program, the pointer points to the first character, so the length of the remaining string is 10. Therefore, the program will output the number 10 five times.
In the second program, the pointer is shifted one character to the right each time, so the answer will decrease by one with each iteration."
